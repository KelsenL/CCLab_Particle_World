  <p>Replicon Explore the evolutionary trajectory of the smallest factors, the molecules, that make up life. In Richard Dawkins' book, The Selfish Gene, he takes Darwin's theory of evolution to the level of the molecule. Life began with the formation and replication of molecules, and in the process of replication, molecules are bound to make “mistakes” and produce variants. The factors that determine the survival of different molecules are:</p>
  <p>1. the rate of replication per molecule</p>
  <p>2. the accuracy of replication per molecule</p>
  <p>3. the length of life per molecule</p>
  <p>In my simulation, I correlate the color and size of the circle representing the molecule with the above three positives.</p>
